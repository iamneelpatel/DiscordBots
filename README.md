## Discord Bots

Hey guys,
 
I have set path on making a few discord bots, this is a very interesting thing to be making because `discord.py` the module that im using Is quite powerful and I would love to explore the different things I can do with its assistance. 

This is my first time using `discord.py` so im going to start with small basics bots and find my way up to the more smarter and complex ones.

### User friendly 

The bots im creating are for everyone, so don't hesitate to implement them in your servers. I will have a small guide on how you can implement them to your server in another `README` file. 

### Contributions 
	
It would be great if you guys could ping me with ways in which i could improve and make my script more efficient as I myself am a student and looking to improve. Thanks.
